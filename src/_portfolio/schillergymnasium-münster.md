**Project Overview** \
Schillergymnasium Münster, a prestigious "Gymnasium" school in Münster, Germany, approached us with a clear goal: to revamp their outdated website to attract new students. Their existing website suffered from navigation difficulties, outdated design, and cumbersome backend content management.

**Our Approach** \
We embarked on this project by researching existing designs for inspiration, striving to create a concept layout that would bring a modern touch to the school's online presence. The school's colors, Navy Blue, Yellow, and White, played a central role in our design concept. We aimed to strike a balance between modernity and sophistication, drawing inspiration from classical "academic" designs, which included prints, stickers, and more. These elements were seamlessly integrated into the final design, particularly in the hero section of each page.

**Technical Challenges** \
During the development phase, we encountered a few technical hurdles. One significant challenge was the integration of a calendar system and the transition from the old server host. The "Vertretungsplan" (a substitute or replacement schedule) was closely tied to this transition. We tackled this issue by employing different approaches, effectively separating the "Vertretungsplan" from the new server and integrating a calendar using external calendar services, such as Google Calendar.

**Key Features** \
To enhance the user experience and meet the school's objectives, we incorporated essential features such as a user-friendly contact form and a registration platform for new students.

**Client Satisfaction** \
Schillergymnasium Münster was pleased with the final product. While minor adjustments were made throughout the project, the overall workflow was smooth and hassle-free. Any requested revisions were promptly implemented, ensuring the client's satisfaction with the end result.

**Measurable Outcomes** \
The new website's improved navigation and modern design are expected to lead to enhanced user engagement, making it easier for prospective students and parents to explore the school's offerings.
