Detailed information can be found in the following privacy policy. You can object to this analysis. We will inform you about the objection options in this privacy policy.</p>




                <h2>2. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
                <h3><strong>Data Protection</strong></h3>
                <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy. When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can be used to personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and how we use it. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens. We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>

                <h3><strong>Responsible Party</strong></h3>
                <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
                <p>Maple Ink inh. Emil Becher<br>Emil Becher<br>Luise-Rappaport-Weg<br>48161 Münster</p>
                <p>Email: info@maple-ink.com<br>Phone: 0152 / 513 69 734</p>
                <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

                <h3><strong>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</strong></h3>
                <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke a previously given consent at any time. For this purpose, an informal notification by email to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

                <h3><strong>Complaint Right with the Competent Supervisory Authority</strong></h3>
                <p>In the case of violations of data protection laws, the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. The competent supervisory authority for data protection issues is the state data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is based. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p>

                <h3><strong>SSL or TLS Encryption</strong></h3>
                <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

                <h3><strong>Information, Blocking, Deletion</strong></h3>
                <p>Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing, and, if necessary, a right to correction, blocking, or deletion of this data.

The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of promotional information, such as spam emails.</p>



                <h2>3. Data Collection on Our Website</h2>
                <h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
                <p>The websites use so-called cookies in part. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies are used to make our offer more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
                <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.</p>
                <p>You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies, allow cookies only in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for specific cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may restrict the functionality of this website.</p>
                <p>Cookies that are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process or for the provision of certain functions you desire (e.g., shopping cart function) are stored based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. Insofar as other cookies (e.g., cookies for analyzing your surfing behavior) are stored, these are treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>


                <h3><strong>Server Log Files</strong></h3>
                <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
                    <li>Operating system used</li>
                    <li>Referrer URL</li>
                    <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
                    <li>Time of the server request</li>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These data are not merged with other data sources.</p>
                <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures.</p>

                <h3><strong>Processing of Data (Customer and Contract Data)</strong></h3>
                <p>We collect, process, and use personal data only to the extent necessary for the establishment, content design, or change of the legal relationship (inventory data). This is done on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures. We collect, process, and use personal data about the use of our websites (usage data) only to the extent necessary to enable the user to use the service or to bill.</p>
                <p>The collected customer data will be deleted after the order is completed or the business relationship is terminated. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.</p>

                <h3><strong>Data Transmission on Conclusion of a Contract for Services and Digital Content</strong></h3>
                <p>We only transmit personal data to third parties if this is necessary in the course of processing the contract, for example, to the bank commissioned with the payment processing.</p>
                <p>Further transmission of the data does not take place or only if you have expressly consented to the transmission. A transfer of your data to third parties without express consent, for example for advertising purposes, does not occur.</p>
                <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures.</p>

                <h3><strong>Contact Form</strong></h3>
                <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
                <p>The processing of the data entered into the contact form is therefore exclusively based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. An informal message by email to us is sufficient for this purpose. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
                <p>The data entered by you in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

                

                <h2>4. Newsletter</h2>
                <h3><strong>Newsletter Data</strong></h3>
                <p>If you want to subscribe to the newsletter offered on the website, we need your email address and information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected or will be collected on a voluntary basis only. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
                <p>The processing of the data entered into the newsletter registration form is based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). The consent given for the storage of data, the email address, and their use for sending the newsletter can be revoked at any time, for example, via the "Unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
                <p>The data you provide for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted after unsubscribing. Data stored by us for other purposes (e.g., email addresses for the members' area) remains unaffected by this.</p>



                <h2>5. Plugins and Tools</h2>
                <h3><strong>Google Web Fonts</strong></h3>

This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
                <p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a default font will be used by your computer.</p>
                <p>For more information about Google Web Fonts, please visit <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
