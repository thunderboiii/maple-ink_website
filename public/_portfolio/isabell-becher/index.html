        <h2>Case Study: Creation of Isabell Becher&#39;s Website</h2>
        
        <p>Isabell Becher is a music and creative therapist based in Münster, Germany. She specializes in helping individuals with mental health issues and provides support to those who are grieving. Isabell wanted a complete overhaul of her website to improve user experience, showcase her therapy services, and effectively convey the benefits of music and creative therapy to potential clients.</p>
<p><strong>Goals and Objectives:</strong> The primary objectives for Isabell Becher's website were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redesign the website to provide an attractive and engaging user experience.</li>
<li>Clearly communicate the benefits of music and creative therapy to potential clients.</li>
<li>Showcase Isabell's expertise and credentials through an informative About page.</li>
<li>Present the various therapy services offered, including Trauerbegleitung and Musik-/Kreativtherapie.</li>
<li>Highlight external projects such as the Mourning Cafe.</li>
<li>Incorporate Isabell's logo ideas and color palette while expanding on them.</li>
<li>Improve the website's visibility through effective SEO strategies.</li>
<li>Complete the project within the specified timeline.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Design Approach:</strong> Given creative freedom, the design team developed a visually appealing and user-friendly website. They created a new logo based on Isabell's existing materials, incorporating her icon within the top of the letter &quot;B.&quot; Additionally, a standalone logo was designed with a turned around bass key and a person laying inside it, representing the therapeutic aspect of her practice.</p>
<p>The color green, which was important to Isabell, was incorporated into the overall color scheme. A serif typography was chosen to convey professionalism and elegance, while ensuring readability.</p>
<p><strong>Website Features:</strong> To enhance user experience, several functionalities were implemented. These included a contact form to facilitate communication between potential clients and Isabell. The back-end functionalities were designed to improve navigation on the website, making it easier for both users and the site administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Content and Structure:</strong> The website was structured to provide clear and concise information to visitors. The About page showcased Isabell's resume, highlighting her qualifications and experience. The Offers section outlined specific therapy services such as Trauerbegleitung and Musik-/Kreativtherapie. A dedicated project page was created to feature external projects, including the Mourning Cafe, which aimed to create a supportive environment for individuals dealing with loss.</p>
<p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Isabell's target audience comprised individuals experiencing mental health issues, those seeking support for grief and mourning, as well as couples interested in therapy with a creative aspect. The website was designed to effectively engage and resonate with this target audience.</p>
<p><strong>Competition and SEO:</strong> The team acknowledged the presence of other therapists in Münster and aimed to differentiate Isabell's website through effective SEO strategies. This involved optimizing content, meta tags, headings, and other on-page elements to improve search engine rankings and increase organic traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline and Completion:</strong> The project was completed within the specified timeline, ensuring all desired features and functionalities were implemented. The website was successfully launched by mid-July, allowing Isabell to reach her target audience and promote her therapy services effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The redesigned website for Isabell Becher provided an improved user experience and effectively communicated the benefits of music and creative therapy. With an engaging design, informative content, and strong SEO optimization, the website attracted more visitors and increased visibility in search engine results. Isabell was able to connect with her target audience, expand her client base, and establish her online presence as a reputable music and creative therapist in Münster.</p>
